# Welcome to the Beta Escape Room Project!

Here, within a team we further developed the Alpha of this project (refer to my repositories page) with new features!

## AI-powered Game Master Presence
- Always visible with a distinct visual form and persona.
- Engages in conversations beyond riddles to demonstrate contextual awareness.
- Acknowledges interactions, eliminating the need for explicit loading messages.

## Application Menu and Difficulty Levels
- Main menu at the start, allowing players to choose difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard.
- Difficulty levels dictate interaction rules and hint availability.
- Option to set a time limit (2, 4, or 6 minutes) applicable to any difficulty level.

## Game Design
- Incorporates slight randomness for replay value.
- Three rooms, with only one having a "locked exit."
- Players must visit and interact in all three rooms to successfully escape.
- Flexibility to switch between rooms at any time during the game.

## Engaging Downtime
- Downtime during loading embodied within the theme for an engaging experience.

## Note on Prompt Engineering
- Consider prompt engineering to discern user requests for hints or casual conversation.
